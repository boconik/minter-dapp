const welcome_p = 'Cool Humpbacks series is an NFT collection created by a young novice programmer and Pixel Art lover as a form of self-expression and educational introduction into Non-fungible Tokens. Those nutty hefty whales are actually very fascinating not only because they are considered to be one of the largest mammals on Earth. They are also a zoomorphic representation of individuals that actually own the largest resources of specific cryptocoins. The name of this animal comes from the characteristic fin on its back that looks like a hump. The little bump emphasizes as Cool Humpbacks raise and bend their backs in preparation for a DIP dive into the CRYPTOOCEAN to find at least ONE GEM that potentially will be providing with massive gains. The words on the reverse side of the token read: Always carry me and rub my hump for good luck.';
